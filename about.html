            <p>
                Hello! I'm Dominique Marcil, a Front-end developer with a passion for creating accesssible web spaces. With a background in graphic design and neurodivergent research, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of accessibility design for those with neuro variances. My journey in front-end development has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a drive to innovate. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that have honed my skills and broadened my perspective. I am always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for accessibility in the digital landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my professional life, I enjoy creative design, reasding, which allows me to bring a well-rounded approach to my work. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in my field.
